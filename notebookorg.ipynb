   "source": "## 1. Import and observe dataset\n<p>We all love watching movies! There are some movies we like, some we don't. Most people have a preference for movies of a similar genre. Some of us love watching action movies, while some of us like watching horror. Some of us like watching movies that have ninjas in them, while some of us like watching superheroes.</p>\n<p>Movies within a genre often share common base parameters. Consider the following two movies:</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin:5px 20px 5px 1px; height: 250px; display: inline-block;\" alt=\"2001: A Space Odyssey\" src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_648/img/movie1.jpg\">\n<img style=\"margin:5px 20px 5px 1px; height: 250px; display: inline-block;\" alt=\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_648/img/movie2.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Both movies, <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> and <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>, are movies based on aliens coming to Earth. I've seen both, and they indeed share many similarities. We could conclude that both of these fall into the same genre of movies based on intuition, but that's no fun in a data science context. In this notebook, we will quantify the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then separate them into groups, also known as clusters. We'll create a dendrogram to represent how closely the movies are related to each other.</p>\n<p>Let's start by importing the dataset and observing the data provided.</p>"

They are the plot found for the movies on Wikipedia and IMDb, respectively. The text in the two columns is similar, however, they are often written in different tones and thus provide context on a movie in a different manner of linguistic expression. Further, sometimes the text in one column may mention a feature of the plot that is not present in the other column. For example, consider the following plot extracts from <em>The Godfather</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wikipedia: \"On the day of his only daughter's wedding, Vito Corleone\"</li>\n<li>IMDb: \"In late summer 1945, guests are gathered for the wedding reception of Don Vito Corleone's daughter Connie\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the Wikipedia plot only mentions it is the day of the daughter's wedding, the IMDb plot also mentions the year of the scene and the name of the daughter. </p>\n<p>Let's combine both the columns to avoid the overheads in computation associated with extra columns to process.</p>"

Hence, we must convert our textual plot summaries to numbers for the computer to be able to extract meaning from them. One simple method of doing this would be to count all the occurrences of each word in the entire vocabulary and return the counts in a vector. Enter <code>CountVectorizer</code>.</p>\n<p>Consider the word 'the'. It appears quite frequently in almost all movie plots and will have a high count in each case. But obviously, it isn't the theme of all the movies! <a href=\"https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/natural-language-processing-fundamentals-in-python/simple-topic-identification?ex=11\">Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency</a> (TF-IDF) is one method which overcomes the shortcomings of <code>CountVectorizer</code>. The Term Frequency of a word is the measure of how often it appears in a document, while the Inverse Document Frequency is the parameter which reduces the importance of a word if it frequently appears in several documents.</p>\n<p>For example, when we apply the TF-IDF on the first 3 sentences from the plot of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, we are told that the most important word there is 'Toto', the pet dog of the lead character. This is because the movie begins with 'Toto' biting someone due to which the journey of Oz begins!</p>\n<p>In simplest terms, TF-IDF recognizes words which are unique and important to any given document. Let's create one for our purposes.</p>"

To do this, we use the <code>fit_transform()</code> method of the <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> object. </p>\n<p>If we observe the <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> object we created, we come across a parameter stopwords. 'stopwords' are those words in a given text which do not contribute considerably towards the meaning of the sentence and are generally grammatical filler words. For example, in the sentence 'Dorothy Gale lives with her dog Toto on the farm of her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry', we could drop the words 'her' and 'the', and still have a similar overall meaning to the sentence. Thus, 'her' and 'the' are stopwords and can be conveniently dropped from the sentence. </p>\n<p>On setting the stopwords to 'english', we direct the vectorizer to drop all stopwords from a pre-defined list of English language stopwords present in the nltk module.

Clustering is the method of grouping together a number of items such that they exhibit similar properties. According to the measure of similarity desired, a given sample of items can have one or more clusters. </p>\n<p>A good basis of clustering in our dataset could be the genre of the movies. Say we could have a cluster '0' which holds movies of the 'Drama' genre. We would expect movies like <em>Chinatown</em> or <em>Psycho</em> to belong to this cluster. Similarly, the cluster '1' in this project holds movies which belong to the 'Adventure' genre (<em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> and the <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, for example).</p>\n<p>K-means is an algorithm which helps us to implement clustering in Python. The name derives from its method of implementation: the given sample is divided into <b><i>K</i></b> clusters where each cluster is denoted by the <b><i>mean</i></b> of all the items lying in that cluster. </p>\n<p>We get the following distribution for the clusters:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_648/img/bar_clusters.png\" alt=\"bar graph of clusters\"></p>"

This means the above sentences are very closely related. <em>Similarity distance</em> is 1 - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity\">cosine similarity angle</a>. This follows from that if the vectors are similar, the cosine of their angle would be 1 and hence, the distance between then would be 1 - 1 = 0.</p>\n<p>Let's calculate the similarity distance for all of our movies.</p>"
